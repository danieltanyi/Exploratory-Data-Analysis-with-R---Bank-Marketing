This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

 **Task**

1.  Explore the data to find how different features (age, job, education, and others) affect the desired outcome (the client subscribed to a term deposit). For this analysis, I will use a marketing KPI called *Conversion Rate*. Conversion rate is the percentage of clients who take the desired action.

2.  Give recommendations for the Bank's marketing strategy and future marketing campaigns.

 **Loading the data and R packages**
 
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
data <- read.csv("C:/Users/dtarh/OneDrive/Documents/R-project2-EDA/EDA With R- Bank Marketing Data Set.Rmd", 
                 header = TRUE, sep = ";")

head(data)
```
